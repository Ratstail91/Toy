# Toy v2.x

The Toy programming language is an imperative, bytecode-interpreted, embeddable scripting language. Rather than functioning independently, it serves as part of another program, the "host". This design allows for straightforward customization by both the hostâ€™s developer and end users, achieved by exposing program logic through text files.

This repository holds the reference implementation for Toy version 2.x, written in C.

# Nifty Features

* Simple C-like syntax
* Intermediate AST representation
* Strong, but optional type system

* Open source under the zlib license
